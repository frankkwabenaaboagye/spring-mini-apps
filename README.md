## AOP
- There are some generic functionalities that are needed in many places in any application code
- With this in mind, there is the need to avoid code tangling and eliminate code scattering
- what can we do? Modularizeüß©? Yes!
- AOP helps to do that üí°
- AOP Technologies - AspectJ, Spring AOP
- Core concepts
    - `Join Point`: A point in the execution of a program - Method calls  or exception
    - `Pointcut` : Expression that selects one or more `join point`
    - `Advice` : Code to be executed at each selected `join point`
    - `Aspect` : Module that encapsulated `Pointcuts` &  `Advice`
    - `Weaving` : Combining `Aspects` with main code
- Defining a pointcut
    - Spring AOP uses AspectJ expression language for selecting where to apply advice
    - When defining pointcut, we're defining designators
    - Designators - `execution`, e.t.c

```java
// format
execution( <method pattern> )

// chain together with &&, ||, !
execution( <pattern 1> ) && execution( <pattern 2> )

// method pattern
[modifiers] ReturnType [ClassType] MethodName(Arguments) [throws ExceptionType]
    // two mandatory things: 
        // ReturnType and 
        // MethodName with Arguments
    
```

- Advice Types
    - `Before` ‚è©
        - Proxy delegates to the advice before delegating to the target‚öôÔ∏è
        - do whatever you want in the advice before executing the business logic
        - if you happen to put an exception on the advice, you prevent the target from executing
            - good for securityüîí use cases 
    - `AfterReturning` ‚Ü©Ô∏è
        - Proxy first delegates to the target‚öôÔ∏è
        - then the proxy delegates to the advice
            - This only happens when there is a successful return from the target
            - there will be more information here because, you will  have
                - the context information
                - with the return from the target
    - `AfterThrowing` ‚ö†Ô∏è
        - Proxy first delegate to the target‚öôÔ∏è
        - then the proxy delegates to the advice
            - This only happens when there is an exception thrown from the target
            - you will have the exception available to you
            - you can throw another exception or allow it to propagate
                - there is a work around this
    - `After` üîö
        - Proxy delegate to the target‚öôÔ∏è
        - then proxy delegate to the advice
        - whether there is a success reutrn or exception, it does not matter
        - advice is excuted after the target‚öôÔ∏è
    - `Around` üîÑ
        - Proxy delegates to the advice
        - it is your responsibility to call `proceed` method to the target‚öôÔ∏è
        - in this way, you can excute things before and after the target - cool! üòé
- Limitations of spring aop
    - can only advise non-private methods
    - can only advise spring beans
    - inner method call inside of a target would not get advised
- Note: AspectJ does not have this limitations

## JDBC
- There are issues with plain Jdbc
    - boilerplate code
    - forced to catch certain exceptions
    - forced to close resources
- Spring JDBC Template solves these issues
    - we a simple statment, spring will be able to handle for us
        - connection
        - statement execution
        - result set processsing
        - exceptions
        - release of connection
- Note: When creating the Jdbc, we need a datasource
